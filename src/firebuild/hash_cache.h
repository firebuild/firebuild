/**
 * This class implements a global (that is, once per firebuild process) in-memory cache of file
 * hashes.
 *
 * This cache stores the hash of files and directories that are found, along with some statinfo that
 * lets determine if the hash needs to be refreshed.
 *
 * Internally, different strategies are used for files under system (read-only) locations (as per
 * the config file) and for non-system (read-write) locations. The public API completely hides this
 * and provides a unified interface for both types.
 *
 * For system locations we expect that they don't change during Firebuild's lifetime. Once cached,
 * the actual file is no longer checked. Nonexisting files are also cached.
 *
 * (Note though: Currently as soon as someone asks for the file's size or permissions, we compute
 * its checksum too. It's very unlikely that a build procedure stat()s a system file successfully
 * and then does not read it. In turn, the code becomes simpler, it doesn't have to cope with files
 * whose size is already cached but the checksum isn't yet. This might change in the future.)
 *
 * For non-system locations we always begin by stat()ing the file, and the cached checksum is
 * forgotten in case of statinfo mismatch. Accordingly, negative entries aren't cached, it just
 * wouldn't make sense.
